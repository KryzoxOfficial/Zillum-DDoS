🧩 Setting Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

Why Use a Virtual Environment?

Using a virtual environment (venv) isolates your dependencies and prevents any permission or conflict issues.

Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

python3 -m venv venv

Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment

source venv/bin/activate

> On Windows:

.\venv\Scripts\activate



Step 3: Install Dependencies Inside Virtual Environment

pip install -r requirements.txt


---

❗ Common Errors & Fixes

Issue: Permission denied Error

Cause: Trying to install modules globally without appropriate permissions.

Solution:

1. Using Virtual Environment (Recommended), or


2. Install locally:

pip install --user -r requirements.txt

python3 k_ddos.py

When prompted, enter the details:

🌐 Target URL/IP: http://example.com

🔥 Port: 80

⏳ Duration (seconds): 60
